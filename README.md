# MPD218-XP

This is an AutoHotkey's Script allowing Control of Carenado C208EX Grand Caravan (G1000)
https://store.x-plane.org/C208B-GRAND-CARAVAN-EX-G1000_p_1137.html
with an Akai MPD218 MIDI Device: Featuring 6 Encoders, and 16 Pads

This was Well Tested, so everything works smothly as expected.
I'm currently planning what more to do with this power.

Put Controller Profiles on [XP]/Output/Preferences/
Open ytouch.ahk with AutoHotkey and ... Voil√†

I may help others with their Specific Aircraft.
I would like to see what else you can do.

## What's New

### 1.1.1
Added Support for Default G1000 (Cessna 172 Skyhawk)
Two Control Profiles are now Available
... Minor Bugfixes and Changes
Still Good with Keyboard

### 1.1.0
Everything has been reworked from scratch to provide a rich and complex control scheme
allowing different operating modes, additional keys, and control over the switches
All 6 Banks (3 with 6 encoders and 3 with 16 pads) are used: AP/PFD/MFD
I will Document those Controls another day. I Hope you like the Code.
Let me know if you find any Bugs, and don't forget to Play with it.
